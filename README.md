I have choosen Spring boot because of its out of the box support to different technologies, Also for DB I have chosen MongoDB becuase it is a NoSQL DB and it is having builtin text search indexing support as well. 

To run the application you need to provide the MongoDB connection url in the application.properties and you can run this application very easily.
