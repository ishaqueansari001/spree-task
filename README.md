I have choosen Spring boot because of its out of the box support to different technologies, Also for DB I have chosen MongoDB becuase it is a NoSQL DB and it is having builtin text search indexing support as well. 

For Rate Limiting I have used resilience4J and Spring DATA JPA for MongoDB, And Spring Authentication  with JWT for the Authentication . 

To run the application you need to provide the MongoDB connection url in the application.properties and you can run this application very easily.
